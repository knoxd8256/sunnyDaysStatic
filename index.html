    <h2>About Sunny Days Playgroup</h2>
    <p>
      Sunny Days is a small home-based playgroup run by me, Mel Knox. We run from Monday through Friday, from 8:30 until 12:30. It is open
      to children 3-6 years of age; potty training is preferred, but I'm happy to help the process along in partnership
      with you. Enrollment is capped at 6 children each day.
      </br> </br>
      The playgroup mingles outside play -- walks, playground time, active group games -- with quieter activities like
      painting, crafts, playdough, and toys that encourage imagination and storytelling. As a person lucky enough to be 
	  bilingual, it will be my joy to introduce the children to some basic conversational French, through games and rhymes.
      The children also participate in making meals, setting and clearing the table, sweeping and tidying up, and
      generally taking care of themselves, their toys, and each other.

      Sunny Days incorporates both inside and outside spaces, with a canopied porch bridging both, especially in nice
      weather. Many activities change and flow with the seasons and the weather.
      <br><br>
      Container gardening, feeding birds and squirrels, and interacting with our family dog and wee fish are a part of our daily
      rhythm.
      <br><br>
      Children will be offered fresh and healthy food for Second Breakfast (midmorning snack). Porridge, homemade soups,
      vegetables and fruits, home baked breads and muffins, barley/rice/quinoa and other grains; all are selected with
      freshness and quality in mind, and sourced locally when possible. As a household with food sensitivities, I am
      very open to make accommodations as needed.

      This additional 3 hour afternoon session is offered from 12:30 until 3:30 on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. It
      includes a rest period for all children present, as well as TeaTime (similar to Second Breakfast above). This
      session is available both as a drop-in first come first served basis, as well as a preset arrangement with its
      own monthly tuition. Capacity is 5 children.
